# Postmortem Report: Resolving the Database Overload Crisis in Greentech Industries Inventory Management System

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** August 14, 2024, 2:00 PM - August 14, 2024, 4:30 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The Inventory Management System was down, preventing 75% of users from accessing inventory data and processing orders. The remaining 25% experienced significant slowdowns.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured database query caused excessive load on the database server, leading to a crash.

## Timeline

- **2:00 PM:** Issue detected by monitoring tool (Datadog) reporting high database CPU usage.
- **2:05 PM:** Alert received by the on-call engineer via PagerDuty.
- **2:10 PM:** Initial investigation began, focusing on recent changes to the database.
- **2:20 PM:** Misleading investigation path: Assumption that the issue was due to increased traffic.
- **2:40 PM:** Database logs reviewed, revealing a specific query causing the load.
- **3:00 PM:** Incident escalated to the database team.
- **3:15 PM:** Database team identified the misconfigured query.
- **3:45 PM:** Query optimized and applied.
- **4:00 PM:** System performance returned to normal.
- **4:30 PM:** Incident marked as resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured database query introduced during a recent update. The query was not properly optimized, resulting in excessive CPU usage that overwhelmed the database server.

**Resolution:**
The database team reviewed and optimized the problematic query. The optimized query reduced the CPU load, allowing the database server to function normally. The fix was applied, and system performance was restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**
- Enhance code review processes to include query optimization checks.
- Implement more comprehensive database monitoring to catch similar issues earlier.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Update the Nginx configuration to better handle traffic spikes.
2. **Add Monitoring on Server Memory:** Implement memory usage monitoring to provide early warnings of potential issues.
3. **Review and Optimize Database Queries:** Conduct a thorough review of all recent database queries and optimize them.
4. **Training Session for Developers:** Provide training on query optimization and efficient database use.
5. **Automate Load Testing:** Implement automated load testing to simulate high traffic and identify potential bottlenecks before they occur.

## Conclusion

This outage highlighted the importance of thorough code reviews and monitoring. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures listed, we aim to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. Our goal is to ensure the reliability and performance of the Inventory Management System for all user
